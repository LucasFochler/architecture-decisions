## Purpose

- This ADR provides normative guidance for implementing Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) data exchange in FActory-X by adopting Catena-X / Tractus-X PCF exchange specification ("standardization triangle": mandatory components, data models, APIs, registration/procedures).
- The objective is interoperability with Catena-X-aligned partners and a verifiable conformance basis


## Roles

- The upstream partner (e.g., supplier) acts as Data Provider of PCF values.

- The downstream partner (e.g., customer) acts as Data Consumer of PCF values.

## API structure

- The partners MUST implement PCF exchange according to Catena-X CX-0136 "Use Case PCF" (v2.2.1) and its defined synchronous and/or asynchronous exchange patterns, including the "standardization triangle" requirements.

- If asynchronous data exchange is used, the PCF Exchange API MUST be implemented as specified (HTTP GET for request, HTTP PUT for response) and MUST be called via EDC communication (not directly).

- If synchronous data exchange is used, the Data Provider MUST register the required submodel endpoint in the Digital Twin (e.g., idShort: "SynchronousPCFExchangeEndpoint") and the synchronous GET MUST be executed via EDC (DSP negotiation + Data Plane) and MUST NOT bypass EDC.

- The partners MUST follow the additional Catena-X standards referenced as supporting standards in CX-0136 (e.g., Digital Twins, Dataspace Connectivity, SAMM), insofar as they are used by the PCF use case.

## Data Models

- PCF payloads MUST conform to the PCF aspect model identifier required by CX-0136 (urn:samm:io.catenax.pcf:9.0.0, as specified) and the corresponding machine-readable artifacts provided in the Tractus-X semantic models repository.

- The semantic model identifier MUST be used by the Data Provider to define the semantics of the transferred data.

- For value-only JSON payloads (e.g., synchronous pull), the response body MUST be value-only JSON conforming to the PCF model and Content-Type MUST be application/json.

## Authentication and Authorization

- Data sharing MUST follow the CX-0136 conformance and proof-of-conformity requirements for Catena-X participants, including that standardized OpenAPI specs and EDC asset/contract structures MUST correspond to the described structure.
- Where policies are used in the PCF exchange context, CX-0136 specifies required minimum policy elements (e.g., Membership, FrameworkAgreement, UsagePurpose) and references the Catena-X policy constraints standard that MUST be followed for providing/consuming data in Catena-X.
